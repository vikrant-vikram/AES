ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS) are developed by NIST under 15
U.S.C. 278g-3 and issued by the Secretary of Commerce under 40 U.S.C. 11331.
1. Name of Standard. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (FIPS 197).
2. Category of Standard. Computer Security Standard, Cryptography.
3. Explanation. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifes a FIPS-approved cryp-
tographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a
symmetric block cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) digital information.
The AES algorithm is capable of using cryptographic keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits to encrypt
and decrypt data in blocks of 128 bits.
4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce.
5. Maintenance Agency. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology, Information Technology Laboratory (ITL).
6. Applicability. Federal Information Processing Standards apply to information systems used
or operated by federal agencies, a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of
an agency. They do not apply to national security systems as defned in 44 U.S.C. 3552.
This Standard may be used by federal agencies to protect information when they have deter-
mined that encryption is appropriate, in accordance with applicable Offce of Management
and Budget and agency policies. Federal agencies may also use alternative methods that NIST
has indicated are appropriate for this purpose.
This Standard may be adopted and used by non-Federal Government organizations.
7. Specifcations. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 197, Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) (affxed).
